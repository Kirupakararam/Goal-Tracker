# Goal-Tracker
Goal-Oriented Progress Tracker
Prompt:
I’m looking to build a tool where users can set personal or team goals and track their progress over time. It should have a dashboard to visualize goals, show how much has been completed, and allow comments or feedback from others. I’d also like a way for users to mark milestones and see their achievements as they move forward.
Must Have:
🎯 Goal cards with progress bars
📝 Comment/feedback system
✅ Milestone markers or badges
